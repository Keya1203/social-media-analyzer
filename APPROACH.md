I implemented a lightweight Social Media Content Analyzer that extracts text from uploaded PDFs and images, then performs basic content analysis. The architecture separates concerns: a React frontend handles file selection and UI, while a Node.js + Express backend performs file parsing and OCR. For PDFs I used `pdf-parse` to preserve line breaks and simple formatting; for images I used `tesseract.js` for OCR. The analyzer computes word count, top words (after removing common stopwords), hashtag counts, and a naive sentiment hint using small custom positive/negative lexicons. CTA presence is checked with a short list (e.g., "follow", "like", "subscribe") and the app offers simple suggestions if CTAs are missing. The design prioritizes clarity and reproducibility—no large ML models or private APIs—so evaluators can run and review the code easily. The code is modular: OCR/parsing utilities live in the backend helper file to simplify testing. Results are shown immediately in the frontend with a preview of extracted text. This minimal, transparent approach meets the assignment requirements while remaining easy to extend into ML-powered recommendations in future iterations.
